# 🛒 E-Commerce Backend API

This project is a robust and extensible e-commerce backend built with Java and Spring Boot, based on a [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGhc5Z-WJSw) and significantly enhanced with **production-ready features** to improve security, scalability, and maintainability. 🚀

## ✨Features

✅ **Request validation**: enforces strict input validation to prevent malformed or malicious data.

✅ **Pagination & sorting**: relevant endpoints (such as products/all) support flexible pagination and sorting for scalability and frontend integration.

✅ **Admin endpoints**: specific routes are marked for `ADMIN` access to allow secure role-based access control if security is added.

🐳 **Docker support**
